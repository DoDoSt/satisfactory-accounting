# Satisfactory Accounting

This is a tool for players of the game Satisfactory. In contrast to many other tools for
Satisfactory which focus on calculating what production lines are needed to set up a new
factory, this tool is intended for keeping track of the factories you already have. It
provides a heirarchical accounting of what inputs are consumed and produced by groups of
factory machines. This allows you to see quickly which resources are available and where,
though it does not keep track of flows, so it does not know where resources come from,
only whether each level has more production than consumption.
